Implementation of Order Statistics Tree (variant of Binary Search Tree)

Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic_tree

Supported operations:

(1) Insertion. Operation complexity O(h)

(2) Median value retrieval. Operation complexity O(h)

where h = height of the BST.

Note: For achieving worst-case complexity O(logn) for operations (1) and (2), a self-banacing tree can be used insted of ordinary BST.
